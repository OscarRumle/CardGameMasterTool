# GAME RULEBOOK

---

---

## INTRODUCTION

A 1v1 tactical card battler where you command a hero, build your army, and upgrade your equipment to defeat your opponent.

**Goal:** Reduce your opponent's hero to 0 health.

**Game Length:** 20-30 minutes

---

## COMPONENTS

### Physical Board
- **2 Hero Boards** - tracks your hero's stats and abilities
- **1 Central Battlefield** - where minions fight
- **Dice Trackers** - Mana (d12), Health (d20), Armor (d12), class resources

### Cards
**Your Deck (~40 cards):**
- Class Cards (unique to your hero)
- Upgrade Cards (improve your hero abilities)

**Equipment Deck (shared):**
- 36 Equipment cards (Weapons, Chest, Jewelry, Relics)
- 9 Consumable Potions (Mana, Health, Knowledge)

---

## SETUP

1. **Choose Your Hero** - Each player takes a hero board and ~40-card deck

2. **Determine First Player** - Coin flip or mutual agreement

3. **Set Starting Values:**
   - Hero Health: **25**
   - Starting Mana: First player **1**, second player **2**
   - Armor: **0**
   - Gold: **0**
   - Class Resource: **0**
   - Equipment Slots: **All empty**

4. **Shuffle and Draw**
   - Shuffle deck
   - First player draws **4 cards**
   - Second player draws **5 cards**

5. **Mulligan (Optional)** - Choose up to **3 cards** to redraw (shuffle back, draw new)

---

## TURN STRUCTURE

**What's a Round?** A round = one turn per player. Round 3 means after both players have taken 3 turns each (6 total turns).

Each turn has **three phases:**

### 1. UPKEEP PHASE
1. **Untap** all your tapped minions
2. **Gain +1 max mana** (up to 10), then **refill mana pool** to max
3. **Draw 1 card**
4. **Trigger** "at start of turn" effects

---

### 2. MAIN PHASE

This is your turn. You can perform any of these actions **in any order**, as many times as you can afford:

**Play Cards (only on your turn):**
- Play minions (pay mana cost)
- Cast spells (pay mana, resolve effect, discard)
- Play upgrades onto hero board (pay mana, permanent)

**Use Hero Abilities (once per turn each):**
- **Hero Power** (costs mana, printed on hero board)
- **Attack** (costs 2 mana, use weapon to damage a target)
- **Defensive Ability** (costs 3 mana, used when taking damage)

**Declare Combat (when ready):**
- Choose which minions attack
- Combat resolves (see Combat Rules below)
- After combat, continue playing cards/using abilities

**Buy from Shop (once per turn):**
- Purchase equipment or consumables from the 5 face-up cards
- Pay gold cost
- Equipment immediately equipped, consumables activate immediately

**Strategy:** Combat happens when YOU choose during Main Phase. You can play cards before, after, or both. You can use Attack ability before or after minion combat. You can buy from shop at any point during your turn.

**When finished, announce "Pass turn"**

---

### 3. END PHASE
1. Trigger "at end of turn" effects
2. **All minions heal to full health**
3. **Gain +1 gold**
4. Pass turn to opponent

---

## COMBAT RULES

Combat happens when you **declare combat** during your Main Phase.

### STEP 1: Declare Attackers
- Choose any **untapped minions** to attack
- **Tap each attacker** (turn sideways)
- Minions with **summoning sickness** (played this turn) cannot attack
- **All attackers attack the enemy hero**

### STEP 2: Declare Blockers
- Opponent chooses **untapped minions** to block
- **Blockers do NOT tap**
- Each blocker blocks **one** attacker
- Multiple blockers **can** gang up on one attacker
- Unblocked attackers damage the defending hero

### STEP 3: Resolve Combat
All damage happens **simultaneously:**

- **Blocked attackers** → Deal damage only to blockers
- **Blockers** → Deal damage back to attackers
- **Unblocked attackers** → Damage defending hero (reduced by armor first)

**If multiple blockers gang up:**
- Attacker chooses **order** blockers take damage
- Must assign **lethal damage** to first blocker before next
- All blockers deal **full damage** to attacker (simultaneously)

**After damage:**
- Minions with damage ≥ health **die** → discard pile
- Attacker gains **gold bounty** for each enemy minion killed
- **Surviving minions heal all damage**

Combat complete. Return to Main Phase.

---

## COMBAT EXAMPLE

**Game State:**
- You: 4/4 Berserker, 2/2 Scout (untapped)
- Opponent: 5/5 Guardian, 3/3 Archer (untapped)
- You: 7 mana, Attack available, Fireball spell (4 mana, 5 damage)

**Option A: Aggressive (clear blockers first)**
1. Fireball on Guardian (4 mana) → dies, gain 3g
2. Attack ability on Archer (2 mana) → dies, take 3 damage back, gain 2g
3. Attack with both minions → 6 damage to face
4. **Result:** Spent 6 mana, took 3 damage, dealt 6 face, cleared board

**Option B: Efficient (save mana, trade minions)**
1. Attack with both minions immediately
2. Guardian blocks Berserker, Archer blocks Scout
3. All minions die, gain 5g total
4. **Result:** Spent 0 mana, cleared board, lost board, banked mana

---

## 📦 COMBAT vs ATTACK ABILITY

**This is important:**

**Minions in combat** only attack the **enemy hero** (not other minions).  
Your opponent **blocks** with their minions to prevent hero damage.

**Your ATTACK ability** (hero ability) **CAN target enemy minions directly.**  
Use it to kill blockers before combat, or finish survivors after.

**Why this matters:**  
You can't swing minions into enemy minions—minions only attack heroes. To kill an enemy minion directly, use your **Attack ability** (2 mana) or cast a **damage spell**.

**Example:**
- You have 3/3 minion, opponent has 4/4 Guardian
- You **CANNOT** attack Guardian with your minion in combat
- You **CAN** use Attack ability (2 mana) to kill Guardian before declaring attackers
- **OR** attack with minion, opponent blocks with Guardian, they trade

This creates decisions: Spend 2 mana to clear blockers first? Or attack and accept trades?

---

## HERO ABILITIES

Your hero board has three ability slots:

### 1. HERO POWER
- **Costs mana** (usually 1-2 mana)
- **Once per turn**
- Class-specific effect (Barbarian: "Gain 2 Armor", Mage: "Gain 1 Spellpower")
- Always useful for spending leftover mana

---

### 2. ATTACK (Using Your Weapon)
- **Costs 2 mana**
- **Once per turn**
- Can be used before or after minion combat

**How it works:**
- Target: enemy minion OR enemy hero
- Deal damage equal to your **weapon damage** (base 2, increased by equipped weapons)
- **When attacking minions:** Take damage back equal to their attack (even if they die)
- **When attacking heroes:** Take damage equal to opponent's weapon
- **Gold bounties:** Gain bounty if your Attack kills a minion

**Tactical timing:**
- **Before combat:** Clear blockers first
- **After combat:** Finish survivors
- **Instead of combat:** Guaranteed hero damage without risking minions

---

### 3. DEFENSIVE ABILITY
- **Costs 3 mana**
- **Once per turn**
- **Timing:** When damage would hit your hero, activate **before** damage applies

**How it works:**
- Must have **3 mana available** when damage incoming
- If multiple sources hit (multiple attackers), choose **one source** to apply Defensive to
- Effect varies by class (e.g., Barbarian: "Gain 2 Armor, take half damage from that source")

**Strategic choices:**
- Which damage source is most threatening?
- Can you afford 3 mana now?
- Worth saving mana for other plays?

---

## EQUIPMENT SYSTEM

Your hero board has four **equipment slots** filled during **shopping phases**:

### 1. WEAPON
- Increases your Attack damage (base 2 + weapon bonuses)
- Automatic on-hit effects
- *Example: "Maelstrom - +1 damage. When you kill a minion with a Weapon Attack, deal 2 damage to another random enemy minion"*

### 2. CHEST
- Increases Health and Armor
- Automatic defensive effects
- *Example: "Vanguard - +5 Health, +2 Armor. First time you take 4+ damage each turn, reduce by 3"*

### 3. JEWELRY
- Gold generation and card draw
- Economic advantages
- *Example: "Lucky Coin - Whenever you kill an enemy minion, gain +1 bonus gold"*

### 4. RELIC
- Passive auras OR activated abilities
- **Passive Relics:** Always-on (*"Radiance - At start of turn, deal 1 damage to all enemy minions"*)
- **Active Relics:** Once-per-game abilities (*"Black King Bar - Once per game, pay 3 mana: Your hero is Immune until end of turn"*)

**Equipping:**
- Purchased equipment **immediately** goes into appropriate slot
- Old equipment **discarded** (removed from game)

---

## UPGRADING ABILITIES

Play **Upgrade cards** from your deck onto hero ability slots for permanent improvements.

**How it works:**
- Pay upgrade's mana cost
- Place on ability slot
- **Replaces** base ability with better version
- **Permanent** for rest of game

**Example:**
- Base: *"Cost 2 mana: Gain 2 Armor"*
- Upgrade: *"Warrior's Resolve"* (3 mana to play)
- New: *"Cost 1 mana: Gain 3 Armor and 1 Rage"*

---

## LEVEL-UP SYSTEM

Every hero has a **level-up quest** with three components:

1. **Condition** - Objective to achieve (e.g., "Have 8+ Armor")
2. **Bonus Effect** - Permanent passive when leveled (e.g., "Your Weapon Attacks deal bonus damage equal to Armor")
3. **Ultimate Access** - Ultimate cards become playable

### Leveling Up
- Meet condition → **leveled up permanently**
- Bonus effect **active rest of game**
- Can now **play Ultimate cards**
- **Once per game only**
- Track your own progress (use dice for cumulative tracking)

**Typical timing:** Turns 5-8 (mid-game power spike)

### Ultimate Cards
- **Cannot play** until leveled up (dead cards before then)
- Once leveled: powerful bombs (board wipes, massive damage, finishers)
- Running 2-4 Ultimates = dead draws early, explosive late

---

## PERSISTENT SHOP SYSTEM

### Shop Structure
- **5 cards face-up at all times** (shared market)
- Both players can see all options
- First-come, first-served
- 45 total items: 36 equipment + 9 consumables

**Three Tier Decks:**
- **Early (Tier 1):** 2-5g items, Rounds 1-3
- **Mid (Tier 2):** 6-8g items, Rounds 4-6
- **Late (Tier 3):** 9-15g items, Round 7+

### Shop Refresh Timing
- **Rounds 1-3:** 5 Early items available (same items all rounds)
- **Round 4:** Refresh → 5 Mid items
- **Rounds 4-6:** Same 5 Mid items available
- **Round 7:** Refresh → 5 Late items
- **Round 7+:** Same 5 Late items for rest of game

### Purchasing Rules
- Buy during Main Phase (once per turn)
- Pay gold cost
- Equipment immediately equipped (replaces old)
- Consumables activate immediately
- Purchased slot stays empty until refresh

### Item Categories

**Equipment (36 items):**
- 7 Weapons (damage scaling)
- 7 Chest pieces (defense/health)
- 7 Jewelry pieces (economy)
- 15 Relics (8 passive, 7 active)

**Consumables (9 items):**
- 3 Mana Potions (+1/+2/+4 max mana)
- 3 Health Potions (restore 4/7/12 health)
- 3 Knowledge Potions (draw 1/3/5 cards)

### Strategic Implications
- Constant economic tension (every turn matters)
- Denial strategies (buy to prevent opponent access)
- Tempo vs value decisions
- Information warfare (both see same options)



---

## WINNING THE GAME

---

## ADVANCED RULES & EDGE CASES

### COMBAT INTERACTIONS

**Multiple Blockers**
When 3 minions block 1 attacker:
- Attacker chooses damage order
- Must assign lethal to first before next
- All blockers deal full damage simultaneously

**Example:** 6/6 attacker vs three 2/2 blockers
- Attacker assigns: 2 to first (dies), 2 to second (dies), 2 to third (dies)
- Attacker takes: 2+2+2 = 6 damage (dies)

---

**Simultaneous Death**
- 3/3 attacker blocked by 3/3 → both die
- Attacker gains blocker's bounty

---

**Hero Damage with Armor**
- 5 Armor, taking 8 damage → lose 5 Armor, take 3 Health damage

---

### HERO ABILITY INTERACTIONS

**Defensive Timing**
Multiple unblocked attackers (4, 3, 2 damage):
- All damage simultaneous, choose **one source** for Defensive
- Choose before damage applies
- Choose highest (4 damage) to minimize total

**Example (Barbarian):**
- Defensive: "Cost 3 mana: Gain 2 Armor, half damage from source"
- Apply to 4 damage → take 2 (halved) + 3 + 2 = **7 total**
- Gain 2 Armor after

---

**Ability Usage Limits**
- Each ability **once per turn total**
- Can't use Hero Power twice (pre and post combat)

---

**Attack vs Combat**
- Attack ability **separate** from Combat Phase
- Can Attack, then declare attackers normally

---

### EQUIPMENT & UPGRADES

**Replacing Equipment**
- Buy new Weapon → old Weapon discarded

---

**Upgrade Permanence**
- Upgrades replace base permanently
- Can't switch back

---

**Multiple Upgrades on Same Slot**
- Second upgrade replaces first
- Only most recent active

---

**Active Relic Usage**
- "Once per game" = one activation entire game

---

### RESOURCE TRACKING

**Mana Cap Breaking**
- Normal max: **10**
- With Mana Potions: up to **12** (dice tracker limit)
- Supreme Mana Potion can push beyond 10

---

**Class Resources**
- **Rage (Barbarian):** Persists, doesn't reset (no max cap currently)
- **Spell Damage (Mage):** Resets after casting damage spell (max 5)
- Check hero board for specifics

---

**Armor Persistence**
- Persists until consumed
- Doesn't reset

---

**Negative Armor**
- Minion at 0 Armor gets -2 Armor → takes +2 extra damage from all sources

---

### CARD INTERACTIONS

**Targeting**
- Unless "enemy minion," can target your own minions

---

**"When this dies" Triggers**
- Combat damage simultaneous
- Minions die
- Triggers resolve immediately

---

**Gold Bounty Timing**
- All bounties gained after combat resolves

---

### SHOPPING SYSTEM

**Shop Refresh Timing**
- Round 4 and Round 7
- 5 new cards replace the old 5
- Empty slots from purchases stay empty until refresh

---

**Purchase Timing**
- Buy during your Main Phase (once per turn)
- Can buy before or after combat
- Strategic timing matters (buy weapon before attacking, etc.)

---

**Shop Denial**
- Can buy items to deny opponent (costs gold)
- Valid strategy if you have gold advantage

---

**Consumable Timing**
- Takes effect immediately, can't save
- Plan purchases carefully

---

### LEVEL-UP SYSTEM

**Losing Condition After Leveling**
- Once leveled, **permanent**
- Stats can drop below threshold

---

**Multiple Conditions**
- Can only level once
- Meeting again does nothing

---

**Ultimates in Opening Hand**
- Dead cards until leveled
- Consider mulliganing

---

**Tracking Cumulative Conditions**
- Use d12/d20 as quest tracker
- Increment when progress made

---

### DECK & DISCARD

**Reshuffling**
- Only discard shuffles
- Hand stays

---

**Empty Deck + Discard**
- Simply don't draw
- Can still play from hand

---

**Discard Inspection**
- Both discards **public**
- Review anytime

---

### MISCELLANEOUS

**Simultaneous Effects**
- Active player chooses order for their effects
- Then opponent's effects

---

**Damage Rounding**
- "Half damage (rounded up)": 5 damage → 3 damage
- Always round **up** unless specified

---

**Conceding**
- Can concede anytime

---

**Language Ambiguity**
- "Target enemy" = opponent's hero or minions
- Unless specific, you choose

---

## COMMON MISTAKES

❌ **"I attack your 4/4 minion with my 3/3"**
- Wrong! Minions only attack heroes. Use Attack ability to kill minions directly.

❌ **"You're blocking with THAT? Let me kill it first"**
- Wrong! Once blockers declared, combat resolves. Kill blockers BEFORE declaring attackers.

❌ **"My minion took 3 damage last turn, still damaged"**
- Wrong! Minions heal all damage at end of turn.

❌ **"I'll use Hero Power twice this turn"**
- Wrong! Each ability once per turn total.
