## TURN STRUCTURE

### Game Structure
- A **round** = both players taking one turn each
- **Shop refreshes at Round 4 and Round 7**
- Games typically end around Round 10-15

### Turn Phases

**UPKEEP PHASE**
1. Untap all your tapped minions
2. Gain +1 max mana (max 10), then refill mana pool to max
3. Draw 1 card
4. Trigger "start of turn" effects

**MAIN PHASE**
Active player may perform actions in any order:
- Play cards from hand
- Use Hero Power (once per turn, costs mana)
- Use Attack (costs 2 mana, once per turn)
- Use Defensive Ability (must have 3 mana available, once per turn, when taking damage)
- Buy from shop (once per turn)
- Declare attackers for combat

**COMBAT PHASE**
When ready during Main Phase, declare combat:

- **Declare Attackers:** Tap minions to attack (all attack defending hero)
- **Declare Blockers:** Defender assigns untapped minions to block
  - Each blocker blocks one attacker
  - Multiple blockers can gang up on one attacker
  - Blockers don't tap
- **Damage Assignment:** If multiple blockers on one attacker, attacker orders blockers and assigns damage (must deal lethal to first before second)
- **Resolve Combat:** All damage simultaneous
  - Blocked attackers damage blockers only
  - Blockers damage attackers
  - Unblocked attackers damage hero (reduced by armor)
  - Minions with damage ≥ health die
  - Bounties awarded immediately

After combat, continue Main Phase actions (if not already used).

**When finished, announce "Pass turn"**

**END PHASE**
1. Gold tracking updates
2. Trigger "end of turn" effects
3. **All minions heal to full health**
4. Pass turn to opponent

---

## HERO BOARD SYSTEM

### Equipment Slots (Left Side)
All equipment purchased with gold from shop, provides passive effects.

**1. Weapon Slot**
- Base weapon damage and offensive effects
- Automatic on-hit effects
- Example: "Maelstrom - Your Weapon Attacks deal +1 damage. When you kill a minion with a Weapon Attack, deal 2 damage to another random enemy minion"

**2. Chest Slot**
- Health, armor, defensive effects
- Automatic survival effects
- Example: "Vanguard - +5 Health, +2 starting Armor. First time you take 4+ damage each turn, reduce by 3"

**3. Jewelry Slot**
- Gold generation, card advantage
- Economic effects
- Example: "Lucky Coin - Whenever you kill an enemy minion, gain +1 bonus gold"

**4. Relic Slot**
- Passive auras OR once-per-game activated abilities
- Special abilities
- Example Passive: "Radiance - At start of turn, deal 1 damage to all enemy minions"
- Example Active: "Black King Bar - Once per game, pay 3 mana: Your hero is Immune until end of turn"

### Hero Ability Slots (Right Side)
Core abilities upgraded by playing Upgrade cards from deck.

**1. Hero Power**
- Active ability, costs mana (usually 1-2)
- Once per turn
- Class-specific effect
- Mana curve smoother
- Example: "Cost 2 mana. Gain 2 Armor"

**2. Attack**
- Active ability, costs 2 mana
- Once per turn, any time during Main Phase
- Base: "Deal weapon damage to target. Take damage back if attacking minion."
- If kills minion, gain bounty
- Example upgrade: "Deal weapon damage +2. If you kill it, don't take damage back"

**3. Defensive Ability**
- Active ability, must have 3 mana available
- Once per turn, when taking damage
- Timing: Activate before damage applies
- If multiple sources hit simultaneously, choose one
- Class-specific effect
- Base: "Gain 2 Armor and take half damage from that source (rounded up)"

### Upgrade System
- Play Upgrade cards from deck onto ability slots (costs mana)
- Replaces base ability permanently
- Creates long-term investment decisions

---

## PERSISTENT SHOP SYSTEM

### Shop Structure
- **5 cards face-up at all times** (shared market)
- Both players can see all options
- First-come, first-served
- 45 total items: 36 equipment + 9 consumables

**Three Tier Decks:**
- **Early (Tier 1):** 2-5g items, Rounds 1-3
- **Mid (Tier 2):** 6-8g items, Rounds 4-6
- **Late (Tier 3):** 9-15g items, Round 7+

### Shop Refresh Timing
- **Rounds 1-3:** 5 Early items available (same items all rounds)
- **Round 4:** Refresh → 5 Mid items
- **Rounds 4-6:** Same 5 Mid items available
- **Round 7:** Refresh → 5 Late items
- **Round 7+:** Same 5 Late items for rest of game

### Purchasing Rules
- Buy during Main Phase (once per turn)
- Pay gold cost
- Equipment immediately equipped (replaces old)
- Consumables activate immediately
- Purchased slot stays empty until refresh

### Item Categories

**Equipment (36 items):**
- 7 Weapons (damage scaling)
- 7 Chest pieces (defense/health)
- 7 Jewelry pieces (economy)
- 15 Relics (8 passive, 7 active)

**Consumables (9 items):**
- **Mana Potions:** +1/+2/+4 max mana (4g/7g/13g)
- **Health Potions:** Restore 4/7/12 health (3g/5g/8g)
- **Knowledge Potions:** Draw 1/3/5 cards (2g/6g/10g)

### Strategic Implications
- Constant economic tension (every turn matters)
- Denial strategies (buy to prevent opponent access)
- Tempo vs value decisions
- Information warfare (both see same options)

---

## COMBAT SYSTEM

### MTG-Style Blocking

**Battlefield:**
- Shared battlefield, your side vs opponent's side
- No fixed position restrictions
- Minions clearly on your side or theirs

**Combat Flow:**
1. **Declare Attackers** - Active player taps minions (they attack hero, not specific minions)
2. **Declare Blockers** - Defender assigns blockers (any blocker can block any attacker)
3. **Damage Assignment** - Attacker orders multiple blockers if gang-up
4. **Resolve** - All damage simultaneous, minions die, bounties awarded

**Key Rules:**
- Attackers tap, blockers don't
- Summoning sickness prevents attacking but not blocking
- Blocking prevents all hero damage from that attacker (even if blockers die)
- All minions heal to full at end of turn

**Multi-Block Example:**
- 6/6 attacker blocked by 2/2 and 3/3
- Attacker orders: 2/2 first, 3/3 second
- Attacker assigns: 2 to first (lethal), 4 to second
- Blockers deal: 5 total to attacker
- Result: 2/2 dies, 3/3 survives at 3/1, attacker survives at 6/1

## LEVEL-UP SYSTEM

### Structure
Every hero has:
1. **One Condition** - Objective to achieve (e.g., "Have 8+ Armor")
2. **One Passive Bonus** - Permanent reward when leveled
3. **Ultimate Access** - Ultimate cards become playable

### Rules
- Level up once per game (permanent)
- Bonus remains active even if condition no longer met
- Ultimates unplayable until leveled (dead cards early)
- Players track own progress (paper/dice for cumulative conditions)

### Condition Types
- **Stat thresholds:** "Have 8+ Armor"
- **Cumulative actions:** "Deal 12+ damage with Weapon Attacks"
- **Board states:** "Control 4+ minions at once"
- **Resource milestones:** "Reach 10 Max Mana"

### Design Principles
- Achievable turns 5-8 (mid-game power spike)
- Reinforces class playstyle
- Creates mini-objectives beyond "reduce opponent to 0"

### Example Level-Ups

**Barbarian:**
- Condition: Have 8+ Armor
- Effect: Your Weapon Attacks deal bonus damage equal to Armor
- Theme: Defense enables offense

**Mage:**
- Condition: Reach 10 Max Mana
- Effect: Your spells cost 1 less
- Theme: Late-game efficiency

## KEYWORDS & MECHANICS

### Universal Mechanics

**Armor**
- Each point reduces incoming damage by 1
- Persists across turns until consumed
- Can go negative (minions take extra damage)
- Example: 3 Armor, take 5 damage → 0 Armor, 2 damage to health

**Bounty**
- Gold awarded when minion dies
- Killing player gains bounty
- Values: 1g (small), 2g (medium), 3g (large)

**Summoning Sickness**
- Cannot attack turn played
- CAN block immediately

**Tapping**

---

### Class-Specific Mechanics

**Rage (Barbarian)**
- Each point: +1 damage on Attack, +1 damage taken per hit
- Persists across turns
- Risk/reward offensive resource
- Example: 3 Rage = Attack deals +3 damage, but take +3 from each incoming hit

**Spell Damage (Mage)**
- When casting damage spell, choose how much to spend (0 to current total)
- Each point spent = +1 spell damage
- Spent amount consumed
- Max 5 Spell Damage
- Example: 4 Spell Damage, cast Fireball (3 base). Spend 3 → 6 damage, 1 Spell Damage remaining

**Channeled (Mage keyword)**
- Bonus effect if you cast another spell this turn first
- Rewards spell chaining
- Example: "Deal 2 damage. Channeled: Deal 4 damage instead"

## DESIGN NOTES

### Player Scaling
- Primary: 1v1
- Future support: 2v2, 3v3 with lane system

### Hero System
- 8 classes planned (Barbarian, Mage, etc.)
- Multiple hero variants per class (future)
- Cross-class heroes (future expansion)

### Randomness Philosophy
- Input randomness preferred (setup variance)
- Minimal output randomness (no dice rolls for actions)
- Card draw provides core variance
- Shop refresh creates economic variance

### Game Length
- Target: 20-30 minutes
- Typical: 10-15 rounds (20-30 turns total)
- Shop refreshes at Round 4 and 7 create clear game phases
